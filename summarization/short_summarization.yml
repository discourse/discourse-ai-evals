      (1) Lila: "We're rolling out the new emoji reaction bar, but QA flagged jitter on mobile.
      I've paused the deploy until we confirm if it's a CSS bug or a rendering issue."
    - |
      (8) Nikhil: "Reproduced the jitter on Safari only. Android Chrome is fine. I'm checking if the
      animation easing we added yesterday is the culprit."
    - |
      (11) Rowan: "Backing out the easing removes the jitter, but we still need the animation for
      parity with chat. Maybe cap the frame rate instead?"
    - |
      (14) Lila: "Frame-rate cap works when we drop the glow effect. Packaging a hotfix now and will
      resume the rollout Monday 14:00 UTC if nobody sees new regressions."
    - |
      (16) Jo: "Verified the hotfix on staging; glow is gone but motion looks smooth. No other reports
      so far."
