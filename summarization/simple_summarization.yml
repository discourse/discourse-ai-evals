      Dogs are man's best friend. They are loyal, loving, and protective.
      They are also very intelligent and can be trained to do many things.
      Dogs are used as service animals, therapy animals, and even as police dogs.
      They are also great companions and can help reduce stress and anxiety. Dogs are truly amazing animals.
